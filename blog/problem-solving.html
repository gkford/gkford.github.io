      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <h2>Sometimes the fastest path is via stopping</h2>

      <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
      
      <h3>…were blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
      
      <p>I stayed up late doing the javascript intro exercises one night. I was enjoying the challenges and making my way through them at a nice pace. Despite this, I was getting tired, and when I got to the final problem of the final stretch challenge, I suddenly could not for the life of me get the answer out. I had answered the questions so far without logging to the console, and wasn’t about to start now, and so kept trying different things but the tests just wouldn’t pass. I became convinced that the tests must be wrong - and checked discord expecting others to have the same problem. When I realised that no, it was just me, I realised it was time to engage one of the best problem solving techniques of all: going to sleep.</p>
      
      <p><br/>The next day, I got out a pencil and paper and wrote out some pseudocode and compared it with my code. I quickly realised I had a bracket in the wrong place, and was returning the result at the end of the first loop. Moving that bracket took about 2 seconds. The moral of the story is that if I work until I am too tired to solve a problem, I have probably also made myself too tired to exercise the self control needed to break from my addiction to the problem and go to sleep. </p>
      
      <h3>…elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
      
      <p>I really enjoyed the fizz buzz problem, in which you have to replace numbers divisible by 3 with Fizz, 5 with Buzz and 15 with FizzBuzz. The trick is that because 15 is divisible by both, you can easily end up with a Fizz or a Buzz where you really need a FizzBuzz. The elegant solution was to simply check for divisibility by 15 first, and manage those cases first so they are out of the equation, rather than attempting to engineer exceptions. I came to this solution basically by taking a trial and error approach and reading the error messages. The real meta-trick to this sort of problem solving (which by no means have mastered) is actually being able to observe the feeling of frustration patiently and let the feelings of curiosity lead the way, so that you remain calm and approach solving the problem systematically, rather than endlessly doing trial and error. In this case it worked relatively quickly - but in more complicated challenges pen, paper and patient analysis is the faster path.</p>
      
      <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
      
      <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
      
      <p><strong>7/10</strong>: I use a pen and paper version of this quite often, but I feel like I am still developing the discipline to do it properly. I usually work until I have a spark of inspiration, and then go try something before I actually work the whole thing out on paper.</p>
      
      <h3>Trying something</h3>
      
      <p><strong>6/10</strong>: I am <em>too</em> confident with this method. I tend to keep trying and trying beyond the point at which the returns from effort are high. I should give up trying earlier and switch methods.</p>
      
      <h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>
      
      <p><strong>6/10</strong>: I’ve never done this with an actual rubber duck, but I do something talk to myself aloud and it helps. Rarely do I do the full process of explaining the problem as though I am talking to a fellow coder.</p>
      
      <h4>Reading error messages:</h4>
      
      <p><strong>8/10</strong>: I am confident with this method, but I don’t always understand the messages and would like to know more about how to interpret them for various languages/situations.</p>
      
      <h4>Console.logging</h4>
      
      <p><strong>7/10</strong>: As with the “just try it” approach, I am <em>too</em> ready to use this method. I sometimes get into a pattern of trying different things and logging out the answer and continue well past the point that I should, even after I’ve started losing track of what I am even trying to do.</p>
      
      <h4>Googling</h4>
      
      <p><strong>7/10</strong>: I have come to appreciate that for certain sorts of problems that figuring out exactly what to google can be quite difficult. This is especially when you don’t know exactly what is going wrong. Sometimes it takes me two or three google searches before I get something close to what I need. What you find on stack overflow can also sometimes look like what you need superficially, but turns out to be different, or a complicated answer leads to another google search and ensuing rabbit hole.</p>
      
      <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
      
      <p><strong>6/10</strong>: I’m actually pretty sure I’ll be good at this come bootcamp, but both because I haven’t had that much difficulty with the tech material so far, and also because I have been working weird hours, I haven’t asked for help yet.</p>
      
      <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
      
      <p><strong>6/10</strong>: The same comments apply as with above.</p>
      
      <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
      
      <p><strong>7/10</strong>: I have identified quite a few challenges I am facing with my approach that I need to fix in the reflection process, and look forward to taking action to improve in the coming weeks.</p>
