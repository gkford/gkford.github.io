      <h1>Values and identity</h1>
      <h2>To thine own self be true </h2>
      <h3>26 April 2022</h3>

      <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>

<p>I deeply value the role of science and technology in society, both for its own sake and the prosperity it has brought us and equally I value the ephemeral and frivolous pursuit of artistic expression. </p>

<p>Curiosity, discovery and truth are at the heart of my values - honesty with others and the search for knowledge through the pursuit of science, reading and discovery. I love to learn and to teach. I am fascinated by systems and feedback loops. </p>

<p>Opposing this, I have a love of chaos, improvisation and creativity. I love stories, theatre, music. I love the irreverence and madness of the works of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>My big 10 personality results echo some of these values. I am high on measures of compassion, openness and enthusiasm. However, I am very low on politeness. I am open, curious and truth seeking - but my honesty can have an edge (which likely bears more careful wielding on my part)</p>

<h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>

<p>Once I was driving out of Wellington and I saw a hitchhiker. He appeared just as I came around a corner, and he looked like he’s been there for a while. It was starting to rain heavily but unfortunately he had chosen a very bad spot - a ramp onto the highway coming out of Wellington. He was positioned such that a driver would only really see him at a time when it was too late to pick him up. It was also impossible to turn around without going about 10 minutes up the highway. Realising this, I knew he would be stuck there all day so I went back and picked him up even though it took me about 30 minutes to do the loop to get back to him.</p>

<p>Why did I undertake this minor good deed? Certainly a sense of empathy. Likely also boredom and the potential for a good anecdote. Probably too a bit of in-group compassion - I had been a hitchhiker in the past and viewed this fellow as part of my ‘tribe’. I probably should have considered my own personal safety - but I didn’t really - though perhaps today I would! I haven’t picked up a hitchhiker since I became a father. It is one of the paradoxes of parenthood that a child brings an extraordinary amount of love, joy, compassion and selflessness to your life, but also an insularity and selfishness for the family unit.</p>

<h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>

<p>I am influenced strongly by the memory of my grandfather, and the respect held for him within my family. He was something of a polymath, but most notable as the engineer for the most computer built in Australia, (the fifth ever in the world). This was a monstrosity made from vacuum tubes and wires that has less processing power than my wrist watch. Even though I barely remember him, he is a hero to me, and I feel I should try to live up to his example. My grandfather was by all accounts very different to me - a humble and perhaps even a shy man, conscientious and brilliant. In fact, we may only be similar in both having an interest in science and technology! Still, I suspect that his role in my family has had a strong impact on the interests I have developed.</p>

<h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>

<p>My strengths are my enthusiasm, assertiveness, hyper-focus and passion. My weaknesses are my distractability, tactlessness and moodiness.</p>

<h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>

<p>I was surprised to learn that it turns out that having good structures, clear goals to work toward and deadlines are extremely motivating for me. This is part of why I have chosen this path of dev academy for my career development. Less surprising is that working in teams is of great benefit given my high level of extraversion - this also is a part of why dev academy should be a good fit for me.</p>

<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>

<p>My ability to hyper focus will be my strongest asset, however it will likely also be my strongest liability, and I will have to learn strategies to avoid going down rabbit holes and obsessing over minor issues, getting stuck on coding problems etc.</p>

<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>

<p>In a past role I avoided conflicts and responded to personality clashes and disagreements with withdrawal, which can lead to downward spiral in team performance and relationships. Since that role I have made a commitment to honesty, and I would make a better effort in future to take a direct but tactful approach. I am inspired by the <em>Crucial Conversations</em> framework and would attempt to follow something like this method in the future. </p>
