      <h2>Javascript, loops, DOM and more </h2>

      <h3>Share an analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>

      <p><br/>Imagine a typical analogue clock hanging on a wall.</p>
      
      <p>The HTML is analogous to the objects and any writing on the clock. The hands of the clock, the face of the clock, the numbers on the clock.</p>
      
      <p>The CSS is analogous to the style of the clock - the font of the numbers, the colour, the size, the shape. To really get into the detail of the analogy, it even represents the position of each of the numbers around in a circle of the clock, and further, the movement of the clock hands around the face and the ticking sound.</p>
      
      <p>The Javascript is analogous to the interactive mechanisms of the clock. If you flip it upside down there may be a knob or buttons you can use to change the time on the clock. These interfaces that allow you to modify the clock are like JS in web development.</p>
      
      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, &#39;waking up&#39; or &#39;brushing your teeth&#39; (but not those).</h3>
      
      <p>Consider the errand of walking to a vending machine down the hall to buy a bottle of milk. </p>
      
      <p>Our errand would involve the following steps:</p>
      
      <pre><code>1. EXIT office
      2. Take a STEP down the hall
      3. Are you at the VENDING MACHINE? 
        If no: loop back to step 2. If yes, continue.
      4. BUY chocolate bar</code></pre>
      
      <p>Control flow is process of following these steps according to some rules. Just like in a recipe, the rules can be implicit. For example, it is implicit that we read a recipe starting at the top of the page with the number 1, and typically proceed down the page following instructions from lowest number to highest.</p>
      
      <p>However the rules about control can also be explicit within the recipe, typically when the implicit rules are to be varied from. A loop is an example of such a variation. When a loop is initiated, this means the recipe should continue from an earlier step in the recipe, and proceed forward from there.</p>
      
      <p>In our example, the loop is initiated at step 3, and loops back to step 2 until the condition of being at the vending machine is met.</p>
      
      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
      
      <p>Imagine you had a weird voodo doll’s house where you could move things around in the dolls house and the things would move for real in the haunted house down the street, but also if things changed in the real house, they would move in the doll’s house.</p>
      
      <p>This would be a DHOM, a “Doll’s house object model”.</p>
      
      <p>The doll’s house is a model of a real house. You can use it to see where objects in the house are. The table is in the dining room. The frying pan is in the kitchen. You can also use the model to move objects around in the real world. Want to put the frying pan object into the dining room? Sure, go ahead and put it on the table. The model changes, the real world changes.</p>
      
      <p>The document object model is basically like this, except the model is a long document saying what objects are in what locations, and the document object model is coupled with a webpage you are building instead of a creepy haunted house.</p>
      
      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
      
      <p>Accessing data from an object is like looking something up in the dictionary. You have to know the word you are looking for and then flip to the corresponding page and retrieve the entry, in this example the meaning of a word.</p>
      
      <p>Accessing data from an array is more like pulling a card from a fan of cards. You can draw from the top, or you can draw the card that is fifth along or 20th along the fan. Once you draw the card, the entry is retrieved, in this case the identify of the card e.g ‘the nine of hearts’.</p>
      
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
      
      <p>A function is a piece of code which is prepared ahead of time to perform some task when you need it to, on the inputs that you need it to perform the tasks on.</p>
      
      <p>This is useful when you have a task that you may need to repeat many times. You can simply call the function rather than rewriting the code. </p>
      
      <p>Use of functions can also reduce the amount of code you need to rewrite if you have to change something in your code. </p>
      
      <p><br/>For example, say you have a function play() that performs 10 tasks on an object. If you were to call play(ball) it would throw the ball then catch it, then bounce it and so on.</p>
      
      <p>What if you wanted to play with a chainsaw instead, you could simply change the code to play(chainsaw) rather than going through all ten commands and changing each one from throw-ball to throw-chainsaw etc.</p>
