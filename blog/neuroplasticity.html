<h3>Research Neuroplasticity</h3>

<h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h4>

<p>The reality of neuroplasticity is a reminder that we can learn and adapt even into old age, and even in response to injuries. It also helps us to understand why good habit are so important and poor ones so damaging. Habits of either valence generate a feedback loop where they become increasingly ingrained in even the physical structure of our brains.</p>

<h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h4>

<p>The concept of neuroplasticity play a role as motivation to keep my positive feedback loops going and to observe negative loops developing and act to shut them down. The benefits of mindfulness and attention training also occur through neuroplasticity, and I intend to make good use of these practices in the coming bootcamp</p>

<h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>

<p><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/</a> gives the following list of ways to improve neuroplasticity:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Intermittent fasting</li>
	<li>Travel</li>
	<li>Mnemomic devices</li>
	<li>Learning a musical instrument</li>
	<li>Non-dominant hand exercises</li>
	<li>Reading fiction</li>
	<li>Expanding your vocabulary</li>
	<li>Creating artwork</li>
	<li>Dancing</li>
	<li>Sleeping</li>
</ul>

<p>I admit I am skeptical that these quite specific examples would really improve all-round neuroplasticity (that is the background rate at which the brain changes) </p>

<p>A more plausible possibility is that general attitude, health (physical and mental) and wellbeing would improve neuroplasticity. It seems more likely that getting the right amount of sleep, practicing mindfulness, having a good attitude (e.g growth mindset) and getting exercise will facilitate mental flexibility and improved capacity to learn new skills.</p>

<h4>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h4>

<p>I found this Tedx talk from Lara Boyd from the University of British Columbia quite engaging:</p>

<h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>

<h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h4>

<p>The growth mindset is a philosophy that our capabilities are malleable and enhanced by being open and vulnerable, believing that we are capable of change, and focusing on working hard rather than leaning on our inherent or ‘ fixed’ characteristics. Such a philosophy could be very useful in the learning of any skill, particularly one where setbacks are likely to be continuous, such as learning to code.</p>

<h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>

<p>I read the key sections of an article by Carol Dweck responding to the studies and meta-analyses that were unable to replicate her work or found the effect of mindset interventions to be weak. I didn’t dig into the detail too deeply, but her argument seemed fairly strong and it looks like there is some sort of effect in large studies although it is weak in the aggregate. This doesn’t rule out the possibility that the impact could be profound for certain individuals.</p>

<h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>

<p>I think the ‘growth mindset’ has a lot of overlap with what I would consider a ‘good attitude’ to learning. For example I think a strong respect for the importance of effort irrespective of inherent ability or even performance at a given task (a key part of the growth mindset) is of great value. I will take this challenge-seeking attitude with me on the course</p>

<h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>

<h4>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h4>

<p>As I had already covered this material as part of the prep week, I had this in mind already as I wrote my learning plan. Challenge-seeking!</p>
