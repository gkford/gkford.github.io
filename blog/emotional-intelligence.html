      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

      <p>Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to see and manage the emotions of the self and others. This breaks down into a number of different skills, which makes emotional intelligence a very broad concept, capturing almost every positive human trait apart from raw processing power.</p>
      
      <p>The following table, from a 2009 paper by Moshe Zeidner, Gerald Matthews, and Richard D. Roberts, gives a breakdown of the four categories of emotional intelligence capabilities proposed by Daniel Goleman.</p>

      <p>It is worth noting that once we breakdown the categories in this way, we can see that mindfulness overlaps strongly with the recognition/self cell of the model. </p>
      
      <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
      
      <p>IQ is a relatively easy to measure factor which seems to capture processing speed and abstract problem solving ability. </p>
      
      <p>EQ is by contrast much harder to measure, and refers to a wide range of skills pertaining to emotional management and recognition. Many of these</p>
      
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      
      <p>Intuitively, it seems that the relationship between EQ, IQ and performance is more likely multiplicative than additive.</p>
      
      <p>EG:</p>
      
      <p>Outcome = EQ x IQ</p>
      
      <p>Vs</p>
      
      <p>Outcome = EQ + IQ</p>
      
      <p>This implies that someone with very high intelligence but very low EQ will do much worse than someone with with average intelligence and good EQ.</p>
      
      <p>An example of this idea is Warren Buffetâ€™s suggestion that an investor with an IQ of 150 would be better off selling 30 IQ points and trading them for more emotional stability.</p>
