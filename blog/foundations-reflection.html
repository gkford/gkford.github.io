      <h1>Foundations Core Reflection</h1>
      <h2>Intangible and indispensable</h2>
      <h3>11 May 2022</h3>

      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
      
      <ol>
        <li>I found my research into emotional intelligence quite useful. In the past considered myself to be someone of basically average or slightly above average emotional intelligence. The Daniel Goleman breakdown of emotional intelligence into the categories of recognition/regulation and self/other allowed me to realise that in fact the space of emotional intelligence is quite varied, and that I am likely a very high in emotional intelligence in some of these areas, and very low EQ in others.</li>
        <li>The listening and looping demonstrated that it is not just the act of listening respectfully, but the demonstration of listening through relaying the information you heard back to your partner that is so powerful in creating a connection. When you repeat what someone said back to them, it makes it common knowledge to both of you that you were listening, and that demonstrates a respect that solidifies a connection.</li>
        <li>The core section on mindfulness was a good demonstration to me that my ego, my inner voice or whatever you might call it, has gone a bit wild in the few years since I last meditated. I am looking forward to reestablishing a mindfulness habit during the bootcamp, and beyond.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      
      <p>Our values motivate our ambitions and behaviour. Being in touch with your values allows you to ensure you are on the right path, and checking back in with your values and the <em>why</em> of your behaviour is a good approach to take when you are struggling.</p>
      
      <p>Empathy is important when writing code that will be readable to others. It is important to put yourselves in the position of people who will read your code in the future in order to create something that strikes the best balance between readability and efficiency (what we might call ‘elegance’).</p>
      
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      
      <p>I got more out of the listening and looping exercise than I might have expected. I’m not sure why I would find this surprising, as I used to facilitate exercises like this in team building and improv workshops. I guess I have become a bit cynical about these exercises in the intervening time since I last engaged in them, and got a bit of a reminder of why I was once so passionate about them.</p>
      
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      
      <p>I am impatient to spend more time on programming and had to really focus in order to spend the requisite time and effort on the core areas. I am happy I did so.</p>
      
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      
      <p>As I discussed in my emotional intelligence post, these sorts of skills have a multiplicative effect on performance. If your emotional intelligence is making a very low contribution, or even a negative contribution, to your overall performance, this will basically wipe out the positive contribution you bring from your practical skills and intelligence. If your emotional intelligence is make a strong negative contribution, you may be unconsciously sabotaging yourself and indeed your whole team. For this reason having good self-awareness and people skills is crucial if you wish to do good in the world. </p>
      
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      
      <p>It does sometimes <em>feel</em> like a waste of time, but that perhaps is exactly why we should pursue it in a formal learning setting. Because of the intangibility of many of these skills, it is easy to underrate their importance. The core learning also allowed for a break from the coding, figuratively ‘using a different part of the brain’, giving the abstract pattern-matching skills a rest and allowing the coding skills to consolidate.</p>
