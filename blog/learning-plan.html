      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <h2>Springboard into tech</h2>
      <h3>23 April 2022</h3>

      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

      <p>My aim is to use this course as a springboard into a technology career. Ideally I would like to take a junior developer role upon the conclusion of this course and from there either advance along the developer role or make a move into an adjacent technology role, potentially as a pre-sales engineer, product owner, or technology sales. </p>

      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>

      <p>I can focus deeply on a topic and make considerable progress quickly. Unfortunately my focus is more fragile than most and this presents a major challenge. It is important to me that I am able to set aside time and create the right environment for ‘deep work’. On the flip side, I also hope to develop a more resilient attention, in particular through the struggles of the bootcamp. </p>

      <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

      <p>I hope to improve my ability to work well with others while under pressure. I would rate myself above average on human skills such as empathy, listening, facilitation and helping to bring about a positive atmosphere. However, I think I perform worse at these things than others of a bad day. I hope to develop strategies to handle difficult situations and pressure to reduce downsides.</p>

      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>

      <p>In the time I have set aside for the foundations course I will work very hard in order to get the most I possibly can from the course. I will work to improve the experience of the others in the course, be they learners, facilitators or others whenever I have the opportunity. For the bootcamp, my partner and I are determined to prioritise my work on this course. I am very grateful that she will be supporting me to do this throughout these 8 weeks so I can really focus on the course. When the work inevitably becomes difficult to manage, the most crucial step for me is to ensure I maintain my mental health by setting aside time for a meditation/mindfulness practice. I have found this to be of great value when I am under stress (and even when I am not!) but it is also something that can easily be lost, leading to a downward spiral. I hereby commit to a mindfulness practice throughout the course, even when things get difficult!</p>

      <p>If I need help, I will seek in from my classmates, my family and the course facilitators, rather than endlessly banging my head against the figurative wall.</p>

      <p>My expectation of the facilitation team is that they will primarily facilitate us to teach ourselves the material, but also be on hand to help us to get ‘unstuck’. </p>

      <p>During the bootcamp I will have to collect my son at the end of the day, and will not be available until he is asleep, usually some time between 7 and 8pm.</p>
