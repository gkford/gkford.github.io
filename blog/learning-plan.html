      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <h2>Springboard into tech</h2>
      <h3>23 April 2022</h3>

      <h2>Update Learning toPlan: Sprint 5</h2>

      <p>Three things have changed for me since the beginning of foundation in terms of how I will approach bootcamp</p>
      
      <p>The first is that I am feeling more confident and excited about learning the material. I have had a lot more fun than I expected, and it seems more likely that I will pursue a coding career path than before. I am also excited about building some projects of my own that seem like they may be feasible - this seemed all but impossible before I began.</p>
      
      <p>The second is that I am clearer on what my limitations are. I struggle with habits around time boxing, version management (atomic committing), giving myself enough time to rest, and having the patience to slow down and approach problems with care rather than continuing to dig pointlessly when I’m hitting granite with my shovel. Learning how to be productive with techniques like this that break up the work while still getting the most out of my intense focus will be a challenge that I predict will have great payoffs if I can succeed.</p>
      
      <p>The third is that I have been inspired by the listening and looping exercises, and would like to spend more time honing my skills in this area both because of the obvious value in terms of team work etc but also because it is a good way to authentically connect with others.</p>
      
      <h2>Original learning plan text:</h2>
      

      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

      <p>My aim is to use this course as a springboard into a technology career. Ideally I would like to take a junior developer role upon the conclusion of this course and from there either advance along the developer role or make a move into an adjacent technology role, potentially as a pre-sales engineer, product owner, or technology sales. </p>

      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>

      <p>I can focus deeply on a topic and make considerable progress quickly. Unfortunately my focus is more fragile than most and this presents a major challenge. It is important to me that I am able to set aside time and create the right environment for ‘deep work’. On the flip side, I also hope to develop a more resilient attention, in particular through the struggles of the bootcamp. </p>

      <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

      <p>I hope to improve my ability to work well with others while under pressure. I would rate myself above average on human skills such as empathy, listening, facilitation and helping to bring about a positive atmosphere. However, I think I perform worse at these things than others of a bad day. I hope to develop strategies to handle difficult situations and pressure to reduce downsides.</p>

      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>

      <p>In the time I have set aside for the foundations course I will work very hard in order to get the most I possibly can from the course. I will work to improve the experience of the others in the course, be they learners, facilitators or others whenever I have the opportunity. For the bootcamp, my partner and I are determined to prioritise my work on this course. I am very grateful that she will be supporting me to do this throughout these 8 weeks so I can really focus on the course. When the work inevitably becomes difficult to manage, the most crucial step for me is to ensure I maintain my mental health by setting aside time for a meditation/mindfulness practice. I have found this to be of great value when I am under stress (and even when I am not!) but it is also something that can easily be lost, leading to a downward spiral. I hereby commit to a mindfulness practice throughout the course, even when things get difficult!</p>

      <p>If I need help, I will seek in from my classmates, my family and the course facilitators, rather than endlessly banging my head against the figurative wall.</p>

      <p>My expectation of the facilitation team is that they will primarily facilitate us to teach ourselves the material, but also be on hand to help us to get ‘unstuck’. </p>

      <p>During the bootcamp I will have to collect my son at the end of the day, and will not be available until he is asleep, usually some time between 7 and 8pm.</p>
